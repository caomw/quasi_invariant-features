Colour Feature Descriptor using OpenCV
based on the work of J. van de Weijer, Th. Gevers, J-M Geusebroek
 in their paper "Edge and Corner Detection by Photometric Quasi-Invariants"

Uses quasi-invariant feature transforms to find important features in images.

All code has been converted from Matlab code to OpenCV c++.

Any help getting the code to work properly would be great. Also if anyone has any suggestions on how to get it setup properly for a release in OpenCV would be fantastic.
